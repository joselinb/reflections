I found this data visualization as a part of a discourse on whether or not this visualization was misleading and climate change propaganda. The visualization is meant to show country level cold and heat annual raw death rates broken down by age group. I do find the having two different scales for excess death rate to be deceiving. The way the visual is split in two it makes the viewer want to draw comparisons between both, although the scale is not the same. Also, the break in the x-axis I feel is not really necessary. I think a better way to bring the point across would be to separate the data into two separate graphs. Although the visualization intends to draw comparisons between the different European countries, the design could be improved. They have total bars as well for the four regions and the different saturation for them is confusing. I definitely think the whole visualization should be redesigned. This was used as a part of a scholarly journal, so I believe a better representation of the data should've been used.
